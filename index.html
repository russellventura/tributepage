        <h3 id="headline">The Range of Computers:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Commodore VIC 20 | 1980 - 1985</strong> - My first experience with the Commodore VIC-20 came after owning both my Commodore 16 and Commodore 64. This had an impact on my experience as I never really got the enjoyment out of this system due to the newer systems I had previously owned. </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commodore 16 | 1984 - 1985</strong> - The Commodore 16 was the very first home computer I owned which was purchase by my Mother as a christmas present.
    
    I was using computers at school at the time (the BBC Model B) and quickly discovered that computers were my thing. I learnt how to program in BASIC on the BBC at school and continued my development on the Commodore 16.
    
    I quickly flew through the user manual and was creating animations using the keyboard characters and the first program I wrote drew a car from the C16 keyboard characters and moved it from left to right on the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commodore 64 | 1982 - 1984</strong> - The Commodore 64 was my second home computer that was purchased by my Father as a christmas present.
    
    So not to disapoint me on Christmas day, he purchased a Commodore 64 around November and as he had no clue how to use it, we set it up to test it to know all would be well on the big day.
    
    I was very excited to see a 64 in person, but that excitement soon changed to disapointment as this 64 was indeed faulty, and my dad took it back to Kays warehouse to get a replacement.
    
    This process went on 2 or 3 times over the next several weeks, christmas came and went and I remember getting a working 64 sometime in February. Back in those days, there was no internet, no ebay and our only resource for getting hold of second hand today’s tech at an affordable price was Kays. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commodore Amiga 500+ | 1987- 1991</strong> - The Commodore Amiga has to be my favourite home computer. This computer looked light years ahead of any other home computer on the market at the time, and even today, still looks fantastic.
    
    I have had several Amiga 500’s over my lifetime but sadly none of them survived, and I even swaped one of an PC Clone (386) as that was the next evolution in home computing at the time.
    
    In terms of hours, I probably spent more time on the Amiga 500 than any other computer I have owned. Continuting from the commodore 64, the same skills were used to upgrade, and acquire software without instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commodore Amiga 2000 | 1987 - 1991</strong> - The Commodore Amiga 200 I purchased in the early 90’s was by far the most expensive computer I have ever purchased at a cost of £2500 and was the first person in the UK to own the Amiga 2000 with this specification.
    
    At the time of purchase, this was the most fully loaded, highest spec Amiga in the country. My Amiga 2000 consisted of the Amiga 2000 with a 40mb SCSI hard drive, an XT Bridge board with 5.25″ floppy drive and the A-Max Macintosh emulator.
    
    Spending this amount of money, I wanted to have this machine to do as much as possible which inlcluded being an Amiga, being an IBM XT and an Apple Macintosh. The machine was able to perform all these functions as specified and I learnt alot on this machine while maintaing my skills on the PC and Macintosh.
    
    I did, however, have a bit of a disaster when I first got this machine. When I first got it home and set up the machine, I plugged everything in, and powered it on. No issues so far, so I pushed the machine to the back wall, and something touched and created a spark inside the machine and from that point onward I could not get the GUI to load.
    
    I was reluctant to send the machine back, as I had only had it for a short while, so to use the machine I learned alot about the Shell CLI and AREXX programming language. Eventually I sent the machine back to be repaired as I was missing out on all the graphical side of the Amiga, and it was repaired and sent back in about a week. From this point forwards I really used this machine for as much as possible. I continually added software, databases, spreadsheets and programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commodore Amiga 1200 | 1992 - 1996</strong> - The Commodore Amiga has to be my favourite home computer. This computer looked light years ahead of any other home computer on the market at the time, and even today, still looks fantastic.
    
    To complete my Amiga collection, I have added an Amiga 1200. I felt my collection needed the best 500 model at the time, an Amiga 2000 as I owned one and wanted to own one again, and now the 1200 which I never owned but was the best model available in the Amiga games machine range with its enhanced chips and technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>BBC Model B | 1981 - 1994</strong> - The BBC Model B was the first computer I ever used and was introduced to it at Elgar High School, Bilford Road, Worcester which I attended from 1982 to 1987.
    
    Once I saw this computer, my life changed! I was doing OK at school, but had a limited attention span and I believe I was in lower group classes than I should have been as I quickly completed the work and often did homework in class as I was so far ahead of the other students. Once I had done this, I was disruptive and a handful for the teachers.
    
    Then I started taking an interest in computers, namely the BBC Model B. It wasl like a light switch went off, and for the first time in my life I knew that I wanted a career in computers. Once I got more involved with the computer all my subject grades went up as I was more activly involved with being interested in education to ensure my goal of being in the computer industry was achieved.
    
    Having said that, computers were still relativly new, and I feel our maths teacher was give computers to teach because of his mathematics knowledge, and we quickly overtook his knowledge of computers and sometimes programmed the computer to play tricks on him while he was teaching.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Amstrad PCW8256 | 1985 - 1998</strong> - I first saw the Amstrad PCW8256 in my commerce class at Elgar Hight School while in the 3rd year of secondary school.
    
    This machine was also responsible for a couple of milestones in my computer development history. Both these things were instrumental on my computer career development and how I function even to this day.
    
    The first thing that had a major impact on my life was when I first saw the machine. I was in the class on my own and was this glowing green screen in the corner and was instantly attracted and had to see what it was. I went up to the machine and pressed a couple of buttons and it beeped and then the whole screen was blank and I was instantly taken over by panic. I thought I had broken it, and when the teacher arrived to take the class, I would be in for it.
    
    This was awful, I felt like most people where technology is concerned, I was afraid of breaking such an expensive computer, so I quickly started to focus on the problem and try and get the machine back to the state it was before I touched it so no one would notice anything had happened. I am not sure how I did it, but 5 minutes later after trying this and that, I got the machine back to the state it was just before the teacher turned up. The effect his had on me was that I never wanted to feel like that again where computers or technology was concerned, and from that moment, I vowed I would learn everything I could and never be afraid of technolgy. I still mess things up, but now its all part of the process and every failure teaches me something. I look back and I am glad of that first horrible experience, as it shaped who I am today.

            <strong>Atari 2600 | 1986 - 1987</strong> - One of the very first games consoles I owned as a child was the Atari 2600 woody. This has now become a true classic and still retains its value in history as a ground breaking console as well as a revival in financial terms.
    
    Alot of yesterday’s technology costs more than when it was new. I remember having a large box full of Atari joysticks as we went through these like a hot knife through butter. Even though the graphics are basic compared to todays standards, the games, gameplay and memories are uncomparable.
    
    One of my favourite cartridges was COMBAT. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spectrum 48K | 1982 - 1992</strong> - I do not recall ever owning a ZX Spectrum as I had other computers at the time and the was a healthy rivalry between manufacturers, and I did not have unlimited funds to have one of every type of machine.
    
    I felt, however, in retrospect that no retro room would be complete without the one and only ZX Spectrum, so I have added one to my collection.
    
    I have, where possible, future proofed it and using todays technology to replace tapes for SD cards, removed weak links in the design such as the heat sink issue and it has been composite modded for modern displays.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple Macintosh Classic II  | 1991 - 1993</strong> - I first saw an Apple Macintosh when I enrolled on the governments YTS (Youth Training Scheme) in 1987. This machine was like being transported to the starship enterprise.
    
    It looked so modern and so far ahead of its time even in 1987. Compared to what I had used before namely the BBC Model B and the Amstrad PCW8256 at school, and the Commodore 16 and Commodore 64 at home this was light years ahead.
    
    I instantly wanted one, but in 1987, these machines were going for between £2,500 and £4,000 each and on my wages of £26 per week on the scheme, to say it was out of reach would be a understatement.
    
    As I started my YTS, I quickly found my feet in the computer section and felt right at home. I quickly got to grasps with this technology using MacPaint, MacWrite, Excel and Word. I quickly passed my CLAIT (Computer Literacy and Information Technology) exams and by the second year of my attendance, I was helping the teach other YTS trainees. With this equipment I took another jump in skills and experience but in addition to technology skills, I also honed my people skills by teaching others what I had been taught.
    
    I quickly got a work placement at one of the best employers in worcester as I was an easy sell with my skills and experience along with abilities to quickly grasp new things and work well in new environments.
    
    For the first year of my YTS, I was working in the accounts department on the companies mainframe vdu’s (IMB 4381 Model 21 with 3724 Mainframe green screen terminals).

            <strong>Texas Instruments TI-99/4A | 1981 - 1984</strong> - The TI-99/4 was a home computer released in late 1979 by Texas Instruments. Based on the Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor originally used in minicomputers, it was the first 16-bit home computer.
    
    The associated video display controller provides color graphics and among the best sprite support of its era. The calculator-style keyboard is a weak point.
    
    TI only provided developer information to select third parties and required distribution via ROM cartridge, both of which resulted in a lack of software.
    
    The TI-99/4A was released in June 1981 to address some of these issues. It simplified the internal design and added a full-travel keyboard, improved graphics, and a unique expansion system. At half the price of the original model, sales picked up significantly. TI supported the 4A with peripherals, including a speech synthesizer and a “Peripheral Expansion System” box to contain hardware add-ons. TI released developer information and tools, but the insistence on remaining sole publisher continued to starve the platform of software.
    
    The TI-99/4A was launched about the same time as the Commodore VIC-20. Commodore’s CEO Jack Tramiel had once been offended by TI’s predatory pricing during the mid-1970s, and retaliated with a price war by repeatedly lowering the price of the VIC-20 and forcing TI to do the same. By 1983, the 99/4A was selling for under US$100, at a loss. Even with the increased user base created by the heavy discounts, after a US$330 million loss in the third quarter of 1983, Texas Instruments announced the discontinuation of the TI-99/4A in October 1983 and stopped production in March 1984.

            <strong>THE C64 Maxi & Mini | 2018 - 2022</strong> - If you wanted to capture your youth and you wanted a Commodore 64 that was full size (virtually identical to the original Commodore 64) built with modern technology, then THE C64 is the obvious choice.
    
    Even though I already own an original breadbin Commodore 64, its still and old 64 and even with future proofing and maintenance I am still restricted to RGB Scart output at best, so this is the ideal solution to provide the best HDMI picture quality.
    
    Even better, you don’t have to wait ages for the games on tape to load. With this solution, its all instant so its a win win.
